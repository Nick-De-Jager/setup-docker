# Setup Docker

A simple setup script to install docker on your linux system.
## FAQ

#### Why did you make this script?

I like to have an easy way to install docker

#### Why did you make it public

Everyone should have access to a simpel setup script instead of needing to find the right commands to install docker.

#### Why should I use this script if I can do it myself?

Everyone has there own choice, I like to use a setup script for programmes I setup regular and others want to run every command by them self.
